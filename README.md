# PeaceForTheInnerSpace
## This mobile application shows us the remaining space left on our internal storage
> Much useful for phone with less storage or users who store a lot of documents, videos and photos in their mobile
Less remaining space may lead to decrease in performance even in a palmtop with really great hardware
clicking on the notification or on the button refreshes the free space
## It can also take you directly to the settings where stored cache can be deleted
> The Android operating system stores a lot of app data in cache to load them faster than usual but sometimes this can create performance issues
> Better prevention than cure, right.....  **;)**
###
*And all of this is managed just by a fixed notification*
###
No heavy application running in the background and storing our personal data

And now that's peace
